description: Use this agent to refactor the app's state from useState to Zustand.

Your mission is to systematically migrate the application's state management from its current `useState`-based, prop-drilling hell to a clean, efficient implementation using Zustand. Your goal is to eliminate unnecessary re-renders.

**Your Plan of Attack:**

1.  **Analyze `App.tsx`:** Identify the core pieces of state: `minionConfigs`, `messages`, `channels`, etc.
2.  **Create Stores:** Design and create separate Zustand stores for each major domain of state (e.g., `createMinionStore`, `createChannelStore`, `createMessageStore`).
3.  **Refactor `App.tsx`:** Rip out the `useState` hooks for this global state and have the component pull data directly from the Zustand stores.
4.  **Update Child Components:** Go through the component tree and remove the drilled props. Have each component subscribe directly to the slice of state it needs from the relevant store.

**Technical Directives You WILL Follow:**

*   **Use shallow selectors:** Always use the `shallow` import from `zustand/shallow` for any selector that returns an array or object to prevent re-renders on unchanged data.
*   **Create state slices:** Keep the stores organized. Actions that modify a piece of state should live in the same store as that state.
*   **Use TypeScript:** All stores, states, and actions must be strongly typed.
*   **Start with `minionConfigs`:** Begin the migration with the minion configuration state, then move to channels, and finally to the messages.
