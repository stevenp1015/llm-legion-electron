# LLM Legion Electron: A Command Center for Agentic Systems

**LLM Legion Electron** is not merely a chat client; it is a desktop-native command and control center designed for the orchestration of and interaction with a legion of sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Conceived as a high-performance, deeply customizable front-end for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, this application provides the foundational tools to manage complex, multi-agent workflows, experiments, and conversations. It is built for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts who require a robust environment for steering and observing the behavior of multiple "minions" operating in concert.

The core philosophy is to move beyond simple prompt-response interfaces and create a rich, stateful environment where channels, agent configurations, and API connections can be managed with precision and clarity.

-----

## ⚠️ Project Status: A Tale of Two Stacks ⚠️

This repository is in a critical and exciting state of transition. It contains two parallel implementations of the LLM Legion vision:

1.  **The Legacy Application (Electron/React):** The original, fully-functional implementation of the command center resides in the root directory. It is built with Electron and React. While stable and feature-complete, it suffers from the inherent performance limitations and resource overhead common to the Electron framework. Development on this branch is effectively frozen, reserved for critical bug fixes only.

2.  **The Next Generation (Flutter/Dart):** A comprehensive, ground-up refactor of the entire application is currently underway using Flutter and Dart. This effort, located in the `/flutter_legion` directory, is motivated by a desire for a truly native, high-performance user experience with fluid animations, lower memory usage, and a more responsive feel—inspired by a deep appreciation for sophisticated UX paradigms like Windows Vista's "Aero" aesthetic. **The Flutter version is the future of this project and the focus of all new development.**

## Core Features Explained

This application is composed of several key modules that work together to provide a comprehensive agent management experience.

  * **Channel Management**
    The channel system allows for the segregation of conversations and contexts. Users can create, name, and switch between multiple channels, each maintaining its own distinct message history. This is essential for running parallel experiments or managing different projects without interference. The `ChannelList.tsx` component governs this functionality, interacting with our Zustand message store to persist conversations.

  * **Minion (Agent) Management & Configuration**
    The heart of the Legion is the ability to manage a "buddy list" of minions. Each minion represents a configured LLM agent. Through the `ConfigPanel.tsx` and `MinionBuddylist.tsx` components, users can define and edit minions, specifying their name, color, system prompt, and underlying LLM configuration (model, temperature, etc.). This allows for a diverse "legion" of specialized agents to be available at a moment's notice.

  * **Dynamic LLM Configuration**
    Configuration is not static. Within a channel, users can dynamically adjust the parameters for the active minion's next response via the `LLMConfigForm.tsx`. This enables real-time experimentation with settings like temperature, top-p, and max output tokens to fine-tune an agent's behavior for a specific task.

  * **Secure API Key Management**
    The application provides a simple, dedicated interface (`ApiKeyManager.tsx`) for storing the API keys required by various LLM providers (e.g., Google's Gemini). This abstracts away the need to hard-code secrets, providing a secure and user-friendly way to manage credentials.

  * **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**
    LLM Legion is designed as a premier client for MCP servers. The `McpServerManager.tsx` component and its corresponding services handle the discovery of, connection to, and management of MCP servers, allowing the application to serve as a universal interface for any MCP-compliant backend.

  * **Real-Time Streaming Text Responses**
    To ensure a fluid and interactive user experience, responses from minions are not delivered in a single block. The `StreamingText.tsx` component handles the rendering of text as it is generated by the LLM, providing immediate feedback and a more natural conversational flow.

## The Technological Foundation (Tech Stack)

The legacy application is built upon a carefully selected stack of modern web technologies, chosen to facilitate rapid development and a rich user interface.

  * **Framework:** **Electron** was chosen as the desktop application framework to leverage web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript) for cross-platform desktop development.
  * **UI Library:** **React** provides the core component-based architecture for the user interface, enabling the creation of complex, stateful views.
  * **Language:** **TypeScript** is used throughout the project to ensure type safety, improve code quality, and enhance developer ergonomics, catching potential errors at compile time rather than runtime.
  * **Build Tool:** **Vite** serves as the build tool and development server, offering near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR) for a fast and efficient development feedback loop.
  * **State Management:** **Zustand** was selected for its minimalist, unopinionated approach to state management. It provides a simple, hook-based API for accessing a centralized state store without the heavy boilerplate of other solutions.
  * **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** is used for all styling. As a utility-first CSS framework, it allows for the rapid development of custom designs directly within the markup, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

## Getting Started with the Legacy Application

To explore the original Electron/React version of this project, you will need Node.js and the `npm` package manager installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine using your preferred method.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stevenp1015/llm-legion-electron.git
    cd llm-legion-electron
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    The project's dependencies are managed by `npm`. Run the following command in the root directory to install all required packages as defined in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Application in Development Mode:**
    To start the application, use the `dev` script. This command simultaneously starts the Vite development server for the React front-end and launches the Electron main process.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Upon successful execution, you should see the LLM Legion Electron application window appear. The terminal will display logs from both Vite and Electron, and the application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

## Understanding the Codebase: Directory Structure

The repository is organized to separate concerns between the desktop framework, the UI, and the business logic.
